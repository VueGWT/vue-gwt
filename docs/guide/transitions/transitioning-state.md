# State Transitions

There is nothing specific to Vue GWT in this part.
You would need to code the transitions code yourself, or code JsInterop for [tween.js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/) though.

Checkout [Vue.js documentation about State Transitions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitioning-state.html).
