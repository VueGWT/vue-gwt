# Routing

If you are building a Single Page Application you probably want routing.
Luckily Vue.js has an [official Router library](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router).

Vue GWT supports this library and we provide [a JsInterop wrapper for you to use](https://github.com/Axellience/vue-router-gwt).

Simply follow [the given instructions](https://github.com/Axellience/vue-router-gwt) to use it in your app.
