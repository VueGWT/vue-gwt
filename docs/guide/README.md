# Introduction

Vue GWT integrates [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with [GWT 2.8](http://www.gwtproject.org/) using [JsInterop](https://github.com/google/jsinterop-base) and [Elemental2](https://github.com/google/elemental2).
It lets you write Vue.js components in Java.

## Features

* **Vue.js** Components with a **Java controller**
* Template expressions **type checking** at compile time
* [**Web Components** (Custom Elements)](advanced/custom-elements.md) support
* **HTML templates are compiled** during Java Compilation (only requires Vue.js runtime)
* Use **regular Java Objects and Collections** in your templates
* Supports [**injection** in Components](essentials/dependency-injection.md)
* Supports **most of Vue.js features**
* Integrates with [GWT Resources](gwt-integration/client-bundles-and-styles.md) and [Widgets](gwt-integration/widgets.md)

## Who is this for?

* You want to code a **Vue app with type checking**, and take advantage of GWT optimizations.
* You have **GWT app**, and you want **easy to write views** with **2 way data binding**.
* You have a **Vue app** and you need to **use a Java library in some Components**.

## GWT?

[GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) or Google Web Toolkit is a **Java to JavaScript Compiler** created by **Google**.
It outputs pure ES5, and doesn't require anything special in the browser to run.
You can see it as TypeScript on steroids.

Some of the biggest Google projects are built with GWT, such as [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), [Inbox](https://inbox.google.com/) and [AdWords](https://adwords.google.com/home/).

## Let's do this!

When you are ready, you can get started with by **[setting Vue GWT up on your project](./project-setup.md)**.
